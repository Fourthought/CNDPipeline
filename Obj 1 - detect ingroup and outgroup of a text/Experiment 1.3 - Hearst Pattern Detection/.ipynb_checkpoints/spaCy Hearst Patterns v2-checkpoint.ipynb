    "In this experiment we test the utility of Hearst Patterns for detecting the ingroup and outgroup of a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment spaCy matcher is used with code adapted from: https://github.com/mmichelsonIF/hearst_patterns_python/blob/master/hearstPatterns/hearstPatterns.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypernym relations are semantic relationships between two concepts: C1 is a hypernym of C2 means that C1 categorizes C2 (e.g. “instrument” is a hypernym of “Piano”). For this research, the phrase, \"America has enemies, such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban\" would return the following '[('Al Qaeda', 'enemy'), ('the Taliban', 'enemy')]'. In this example, the categorising term 'enemy' is a hypernym of both 'Al Qaeda' and the 'Taliban'; conversely 'al Qaeda' and 'the Tabliban' are hyponyms of 'enemy'. Using this technique, hypernym terms could be classified as ingroup or outgroup and named entities identified as hyponym terms could be identified as either group."
