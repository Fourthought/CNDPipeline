{"0": "A Message From Usama Bin Muhammad Bin Ladin unto His Muslim Brethren All Over The World"}
{"1": "As stated by the people of knowledge, it is not a secret that to use man-made law instead of the Shari'ah and to support the infidels against the Muslims is one of the ten \"voiders\" that would strip a person from his Islamic status (turn a Muslim into a Mushrik, non-believer status)."}
{"2": "The right answer is to follow what have been decided by the people of knowledge, as was said by Ibn Taymiyyah (Allah's mercy upon him): \"People of Islam should join forces and support each other to get rid of the main Kufr that is controlling the countries of the Islamic world, even to bear the lesser damage to get rid of the major one, i.e., the great Kufr."}
{"3": "I would like here to alert my brothers, the Mujahideen, the sons of the nation, to protect this (oil) wealth and not to include it in the battle, as it is a great Islamic wealth and a large economical power essential for the soon to be established Islamic state, by Allah's Permission and Grace."}
{"4": "To those little group of men within the army, police and security forces, who have been tricked and pressurised by the regime to attack the Muslims and spill their blood, we would like to remind them of the narration: (I promise war against those who take my friends as their enemy) narrated by Al-Bukhari; and his saying (Allah's Blessings and Salutations be on him): On the Day of Judgement, a man comes holding another, complaining about being slain by him."}
{"5": "Security men are especially asked to cover up for the Mujahideen and to assist them as much as possible against the occupying enemy; and to spread rumours, fear and discouragement among the members of the enemy forces."}
{"6": "My Muslim Brothers (particularly those of the Arab Peninsula):"}
{"7": "The money you pay to buy American goods will be transformed into bullets and used against our brothers in Palestine and tomorrow (in the future) against our sons in the land of the two Holy Places."}
{"8": "However, if Muslims don't cooperate and support their Mujahideen brothers, then, in effect, they are supplying the army of the enemy with financial help and extending the war and increasing the suffering of the Muslims."}
{"9": "The children of Iraq are our children."}
{"10": "(Allah's Blessings and Salutations be upon both of them) after the battle of Ahzab, when the Messenger of Allah (Allah's Blessings and Salutations may be on him) returned to Medina, and before putting his sword aside, Jibreel"}
